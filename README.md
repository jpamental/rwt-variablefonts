# Responsive Web Typography Variable Fonts Demo
Demonstration of typographic possibilities with and implementation of the new variable font format.

## Requirements
At this time the only way to view this is with the WebKit Nightly build (MacOS only), which you can download here:
https://webkit.org/downloads/

I'll update this as browser support and the CSS implementation becomes more widely available and implemented. Many, many thanks to @litherum (https://github.com/litherum) for making this possible!
